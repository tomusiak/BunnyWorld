Isabelle Zhou
- Shape 
  1) Implemented all class variables, methods, and functionality after creating class design based on spec
  2) Implemented additional helper methods (i.e. scriptHasGoto()) as needed for ease of use with other project files
- PlayActivity
  1) Built multi-part script parsing algorithm that reads in Shape scripts and executes appropriate actions
    a) Parsed all triggers (on click, on enter, on drop)
    b) Parsed all actions (goto, play, hide, show)
    c) Parsed all relevant objects (Shapes, sounds, Pages)
  2) Implemented hide, show, and switch page methods called during execution of scripts
  3) Created helper methods to enable ease of access to script parsing results through other project files
- PlayView
  1) Developed support for interfacing with PlayActivity through hide, show, and switch page methods
- Database
  1) Initialized carrot and fire images for pre-loaded starter game
- EXTENSIONS
  1) Robust error checking with regards to scripts
     1) Once a Shape is deleted, references to that Shape are removed from the scripts of all other Shapes
     2) Support for duplicate page/shape names and renaming page/shape names through an immutable internal ID system 
     connected to these external names through HashMap and data structure design
     3) Empty or invalid scripts will not execute
  3) Created original image and sound resource files (patrick.png and scream.mp3)
